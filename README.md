# JS-Project
This is a project "Who wants to be a millionaire"

This project takes in the entered name at the beginning. This name appears on the screen for the duration of the game.

The contestant is presented with fifteen questions (1 at a time) and four possible answers.
If the correct answer is chosen the bar moves up the money list on the right side of the screen.
If the wrong answer is chosen the game finishes immediately.
There are three ‘safe havens’ in the question structure (Questions five, ten and fifteen). Contestants accumulate money with each correct answer, but if you answer incorrectly before reaching a safe haven, you stand to lose a large amount of winnings.
Also, for every question there is a time(15s) to answer.
After completing the game, a summary page is displayed containing a summary of the questions and answers used, as well as questions that were answered incorrectly and the correct answers to them.
